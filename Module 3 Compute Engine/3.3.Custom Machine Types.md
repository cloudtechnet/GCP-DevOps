## Custom Machine Types

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Custom Machine Types** allow you to **define your own virtual machine configuration** by selecting the exact number of **vCPUs and memory** instead of using fixed, predefined VM sizes.

This helps achieve **better performance and cost optimization**.

## 1️⃣ What Are Custom Machine Types?

* User-defined VM configurations
* Choose **exact vCPU count**
* Choose **exact memory size**
* Available in most general-purpose machine families
* Ideal when predefined machine types don’t fit your workload

---

## 2️⃣ Why Use Custom Machine Types?

### 🔹 Cost Optimization

* Avoid paying for unused resources
* Right-size workloads
* Lower monthly cloud bills

### 🔹 Performance Tuning

* Allocate resources precisely
* Match application requirements
* Reduce performance bottlenecks

---

## 3️⃣ Real-Time Use Cases

* Legacy application migration (on-prem → GCP)
* Applications needing **more CPU but less memory**
* Applications needing **more memory but fewer CPUs**
* Dev/Test environments with specific sizing needs

---

## 4️⃣ How Custom Machine Types Work

You define:

* Number of **vCPUs**
* Amount of **RAM (GB)**

GCP calculates pricing based on:

* vCPU count
* Memory allocated
* VM running time

## 5️⃣ Custom vs Predefined Machine Types

| Feature         | Custom              | Predefined         |
| --------------- | ------------------- | ------------------ |
| CPU & Memory    | User-defined        | Fixed              |
| Cost Efficiency | High                | Medium             |
| Flexibility     | Very high           | Limited            |
| Best For        | Optimized workloads | Standard workloads |

---

## 6️⃣ Limitations to Know

* Minimum and maximum CPU/memory limits apply
* Not available for all specialized machine families
* Very large custom machines may have region restrictions

---

## 7️⃣ When Not to Use Custom Machines?

* Simple workloads where predefined sizes fit well
* GPU-heavy or specialized workloads
* Temporary or short-lived testing VMs

---

## ✅ In Simple Words

* Custom machine types let you **build your own VM size**
* You pay only for what you need
* Best for **cost and performance optimization**

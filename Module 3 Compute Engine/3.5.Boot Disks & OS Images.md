## Boot Disks & OS Images

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **OS Images** and **Boot Disks** are fundamental building blocks for **Compute Engine virtual machines**. They determine **which operating system a VM runs** and **where that OS resides**.

---

## 1️⃣ OS Images

An **OS Image** is a **read-only template** that contains:

* An operating system (Linux or Windows)
* Base system packages and configurations
* Optional preinstalled software

### Key Characteristics:

* Used to **create boot disks**
* Reusable across multiple VMs
* Can be **public**, **custom**, or **shared**
* Maintained independently of running VMs

### Types of OS Images:

* **Public images**: Provided and patched by Google or partners
* **Custom images**: Created from your own VM for standardization
* **Image families**: Always point to the latest version of an OS

## 2️⃣ Boot Disks

A **Boot Disk** is a **persistent disk** attached to a VM that:

* Stores the operating system
* Contains system and startup files
* Enables the VM to boot and operate

### Key Characteristics:

* Created **from an OS image**
* Mandatory for every VM
* Persists when the VM is stopped
* Can be set to auto-delete or retain on VM deletion

## 3️⃣ Relationship Between OS Images & Boot Disks

* **OS Image** → Template (source)
* **Boot Disk** → Actual disk created from the image
* One image can create **multiple boot disks**
* A VM can have **only one boot disk**, but many data disks

📌 Easy analogy:

* OS Image = ISO/DVD
* Boot Disk = Installed OS on hard drive

## 4️⃣ Boot Disk Configuration Options

When creating a VM, you can define:

* Disk size
* Disk type (standard, balanced, SSD)
* Encryption (Google-managed or customer-managed)
* Auto-delete behavior

---

## 5️⃣ Why Boot Disks & OS Images Matter

* Ensure consistent OS deployments
* Enable fast VM provisioning
* Support backup, recovery, and automation
* Help enforce enterprise standards

## ✅ In Simple Words

* **OS Image** decides *which OS you install*
* **Boot Disk** is *where that OS actually runs*
* Both are essential to start and run a VM in GCP

## VM Cost Optimization

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **VM Cost Optimization** focuses on **reducing Compute Engine expenses** while maintaining required **performance, availability, and reliability**. It is a critical responsibility for **cloud engineers and DevOps teams**.

## 1️⃣ Right-Sizing Virtual Machines

### What it Means:

* Choose the **correct CPU and memory** for workloads
* Avoid over-provisioning

### How It Helps:

* Prevents paying for unused resources
* Improves performance-to-cost ratio

📌 Use monitoring data to resize VMs based on actual usage.

## 2️⃣ Use Custom Machine Types

### What it Means:

* Define exact vCPU and RAM requirements
* Avoid fixed predefined sizes

### How It Helps:

* Fine-grained resource control
* Lower monthly bills for optimized workloads

---

## 3️⃣ Stop Unused or Idle VMs

### What it Means:

* Shut down VMs when not required
* Especially useful for Dev/Test environments

### How It Helps:

* Compute charges stop when VM is stopped
* Only disk storage costs remain

---

## 4️⃣ Sustained Use Discounts (Automatic)

### What it Means:

* GCP automatically applies discounts for long-running VMs
* No commitment required

### How It Helps:

* Lower effective hourly cost
* Ideal for always-on workloads

---

## 5️⃣ Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)

### What it Means:

* Commit to 1-year or 3-year VM usage
* Receive significant discounts

### How It Helps:

* Large cost savings for predictable production workloads

---

## 6️⃣ Use Preemptible / Spot VMs

### What it Means:

* Low-cost VMs that can be interrupted
* Suitable for fault-tolerant workloads

### How It Helps:

* Up to **80% cheaper**
* Ideal for batch jobs, CI/CD, and analytics

---

## 7️⃣ Choose the Right Disk Type

### What it Means:

* Use standard disks where high IOPS are not required
* Avoid overusing SSDs

### How It Helps:

* Storage costs reduced significantly

---

## 8️⃣ Automate Start/Stop Schedules

### What it Means:

* Automatically shut down VMs during non-working hours

### How It Helps:

* Reduces unnecessary runtime costs
* Perfect for non-production environments

---

## 9️⃣ Monitor & Set Budgets

### What it Means:

* Track VM costs using billing reports
* Set alerts to avoid surprises

### How It Helps:

* Early detection of cost spikes
* Better financial control

---

## ✅ In Simple Words

* Use the **right VM size**
* Stop VMs when not needed
* Take advantage of **discounts**
* Automate wherever possible

👉 Effective VM cost optimization can reduce cloud bills by **30–60%** without affecting performance.

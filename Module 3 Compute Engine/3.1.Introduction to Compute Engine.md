## Introduction to GCP Compute Engine

**Compute Engine** is the **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** offering of **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** that allows you to **create and run virtual machines (VMs)** on Google’s global infrastructure.

It provides **full control over the operating system, CPU, memory, storage, and networking**, similar to a traditional physical server—but hosted in the cloud.

## 1️⃣ What Is Compute Engine?

* A service to run **virtual machines on Google Cloud**
* Supports **Linux and Windows** operating systems
* Highly scalable, secure, and reliable
* Used for running **applications, databases, backend services, and workloads**

In simple terms, **Compute Engine = Virtual Servers in GCP**.

## GCP Pricing & Billing Basics

**Google Cloud Platform (GCP)** follows a **pay-as-you-go** pricing model. You pay **only for what you use**, without upfront investment or long-term commitments.

## 1️⃣ Pay-As-You-Go Pricing

### Key Points:

* No upfront cost
* No termination fees
* Billed based on **actual usage**
* Charges are calculated per **second, minute, or hour** depending on the service

### Example:

If a virtual machine runs only for 2 hours, you are billed **only for those 2 hours**, not for the entire day.

## 2️⃣ Billing Account

A **Billing Account** is required to use paid GCP services.

### Key Points:

* Linked to one or more **projects**
* Controls **payments and invoices**
* Can be **self-serve** or **invoiced** (enterprise customers)
* Multiple projects can share a single billing account

### Why It Matters:

* Centralized cost management
* Easier accounting and tracking

## 3️⃣ Project-Level Billing

### Key Points:

* Every GCP **project** must be linked to a billing account
* All resource usage inside a project is charged to that billing account
* Billing can be **enabled or disabled** per project

### Benefit:

* Clear cost separation between **Dev, Test, and Prod** environments

---

## 4️⃣ Pricing Model (What You Pay For)

You are charged based on:

* **Compute usage** (VM runtime, CPUs, memory)
* **Storage consumption** (GB per month)
* **Network usage** (data transfer)
* **Managed services usage** (databases, analytics, AI services)

Only **consumed resources** are billed.

## 5️⃣ Sustained Use Discounts

### Key Points:

* Automatically applied
* No upfront commitment required
* More usage → more discount

### Example:

Running a VM continuously for most of the month results in **lower per-hour cost**.

---

## 6️⃣ Committed Use Discounts (CUDs)

### Key Points:

* Commit to 1-year or 3-year usage
* Receive significant discounts
* Best for predictable workloads

### Use Case:

Production environments with stable workloads.

## 8️⃣ Budget & Alerts

### Key Points:

* Set monthly or project-level budgets
* Get email alerts when spending crosses thresholds
* Helps control costs in learning and production environments

## ✅ In Simple Words

* You pay only for what you use
* Billing is managed via a billing account
* Costs are tracked at the project level
* Discounts reduce long-term costs automatically

## GCP Resource Hierarchy

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, all cloud resources are organized in a **hierarchical structure**. This hierarchy helps in **managing access control (IAM), billing, policies, and resource organization** in a structured and secure way.

The GCP resource hierarchy consists of **Organization → Folder → Project**.

## 1️⃣ Organization

An **Organization** is the **top-level resource** in GCP.

### Key Points:

* Represents a **company or enterprise**
* Automatically created when a company uses **Google Workspace or Cloud Identity**
* Acts as the **root node** of the hierarchy
* Central place to apply **security policies and IAM roles**
* All folders and projects belong to an organization

### Why Organization Is Important:

* Enforces **company-wide policies**
* Centralized **identity and access management**
* Required for **enterprise-scale environments**

📌 Example:
A company creates a GCP account and gets one Organization representing the entire business.

## 2️⃣ Folder

A **Folder** is an **optional grouping layer** between Organization and Project.

### Key Points:

* Used to **group related projects**
* Can be **nested** (folders inside folders)
* Inherits policies from the Organization
* Helps structure resources by **department, team, environment, or application**

### Why Folders Matter:

* Simplifies **access control**
* Enables **policy inheritance**
* Makes large environments easier to manage

📌 Common Folder Structures:

* By department: Finance, HR, IT
* By environment: Dev, Test, Prod
* By application: ERP, CRM, Billing

## 3️⃣ Project

A **Project** is the **most important working unit** in GCP.

### Key Points:

* All GCP resources are **created inside a project**
* Each project has:

  * Project ID
  * Project Name
  * Billing account
* IAM roles are commonly assigned at the **project level**
* Acts as a **security and billing boundary**

### Why Projects Matter:

* Resource isolation
* Cost tracking and billing control
* Access control per application or environment

📌 Example:

* One project for Dev environment
* One project for Prod environment

## 🔁 Hierarchy Flow

```
Organization
   └── Folder(s)
         └── Project(s)
               └── Resources (VMs, Storage, Databases, etc.)
```

---

## ✅ In Simple Words

* **Organization** = Company level control
* **Folder** = Logical grouping for management
* **Project** = Where actual cloud resources live

# GCP Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, a **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** is a **secure, isolated network** where you deploy and manage your cloud resources such as virtual machines, databases, and load balancers.

It acts like your **private data center network**, but fully managed in the cloud.

## 1️⃣ What Is a VPC?

A VPC is:

* A logically isolated virtual network
* Global in scope (spans multiple regions)
* Used to control IP addressing and communication
* Fully customizable

It connects all your cloud resources securely.

---

## 2️⃣ Key Components of a VPC

### 🔹 Subnets

* Regional segments inside a VPC
* Defined using CIDR IP ranges
* Resources (VMs) are deployed inside subnets

Example:

* `10.0.1.0/24` in us-central1
* `10.0.2.0/24` in us-east1

---

### 🔹 Firewall Rules

* Control inbound and outbound traffic
* Based on:

  * Protocol (TCP, UDP, ICMP)
  * Ports (22, 80, 443)
  * Source IP ranges
* Applied at VPC level

Example:
Allow SSH (port 22) only from office IP.

---

### 🔹 Routes

* Define how traffic flows
* Control internet access
* Support custom routing

---

### 🔹 IP Addresses

* **Internal IP** → Private communication inside VPC
* **External IP** → Internet access

---

## 3️⃣ Global Nature of GCP VPC

Unlike traditional networks:

* VPC is global
* Subnets are regional
* Resources in different regions can communicate securely over Google’s private backbone

---

## 4️⃣ Types of VPC

### 🔹 Default VPC

* Automatically created
* Pre-configured subnets
* Suitable for learning and small setups

### 🔹 Custom VPC

* Fully manual configuration
* Full control over IP planning
* Recommended for production environments

## 5️⃣ Real-World Example

An eCommerce application:

* Web servers in public subnet
* Application servers in private subnet
* Database in restricted subnet
* Firewall allows:

  * Internet → Web
  * Web → App
  * App → DB
  * DB → No external access

This design improves security and control.

## 6️⃣ Why VPC Is Important

✔ Network isolation
✔ Traffic control
✔ Secure communication
✔ Hybrid connectivity (VPN, Interconnect)
✔ Scalable architecture

## ✅ In Simple Words

* VPC is your **private cloud network**
* Subnets divide it
* Firewall rules protect it
* Routes manage traffic
* It securely connects all your cloud resources

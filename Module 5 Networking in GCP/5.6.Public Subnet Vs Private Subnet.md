# Public Subnet vs Private Subnet (GCP Concept)

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, subnets themselves are just IP ranges inside a VPC.
However, we logically classify them as **Public** or **Private** based on how internet access is configured.

👉 The difference is about **internet accessibility**, not a separate subnet type in GCP.

# 1️⃣ Public Subnet

A subnet is considered **Public** when:

* VMs have **external (public) IP addresses**
* A route exists to the **Internet Gateway (0.0.0.0/0)**
* Firewall allows inbound internet traffic

## 🔹 Characteristics

✔ Direct internet access
✔ Can serve public traffic
✔ Exposed to external users
✔ Needs strict firewall rules

## 🔹 Common Use Cases

* Web servers
* Load balancers
* Bastion hosts
* Public APIs

---

## 🌍 Real-World Example

An eCommerce website:

* Web servers placed in public subnet
* Allow HTTP (80) and HTTPS (443)
* Users access website from internet

---

# 2️⃣ Private Subnet

A subnet is considered **Private** when:

* VMs do NOT have external IP addresses
* No direct inbound internet access
* Internet access (if needed) is through:

  * NAT Gateway
  * Proxy
  * Bastion host

## 🔹 Characteristics

✔ No direct internet exposure
✔ More secure
✔ Used for internal services

## 🔹 Common Use Cases

* Application servers
* Database servers
* Internal microservices
* Backend APIs

---

## 🔐 Real-World Example

Same eCommerce system:

* App servers in private subnet
* Database in private subnet
* Only web servers can communicate with app servers
* Database accessible only by app servers

Users cannot directly access database from internet.

# 3️⃣ Key Differences

| Feature         | Public Subnet | Private Subnet     |
| --------------- | ------------- | ------------------ |
| External IP     | Yes           | No                 |
| Internet Access | Direct        | Indirect (via NAT) |
| Security Level  | Lower         | Higher             |
| Used For        | Frontend      | Backend            |
| Exposure        | Public-facing | Internal only      |

# 4️⃣ Typical 3-Tier Architecture

* Public Subnet → Web layer
* Private Subnet → Application layer
* Restricted Subnet → Database layer

Each layer protected by firewall rules.

# 5️⃣ Important Clarification (GCP Specific)

In GCP:

* Subnets are not automatically public or private.
* The classification depends on:

  * External IP assignment
  * Routing
  * Firewall configuration

# ✅ In Simple Words

Public Subnet → Direct internet access
Private Subnet → No direct internet access

Public = Front door
Private = Inside secure room

# Default VPC vs Custom VPC

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, when you create a new project, a **Default VPC** is automatically created. However, for production environments, most organizations use a **Custom VPC**.

Let’s clearly understand the difference.

---

# 1️⃣ Default VPC

The **Default VPC** is automatically created when a new GCP project is created.

## 🔹 Key Features

* Auto mode network
* Subnets automatically created in all regions
* Predefined firewall rules:

  * Allow internal communication
  * Allow SSH (22)
  * Allow RDP (3389)
  * Allow ICMP

## 🔹 Advantages

✔ Quick setup
✔ No manual configuration
✔ Good for labs and learning

## 🔹 Limitations

❌ Less control over IP ranges
❌ Broad firewall rules (less secure)
❌ Not ideal for production security standards

# 2️⃣ Custom VPC

A **Custom VPC** is manually created and fully controlled by you.

## 🔹 Key Features

* No automatic subnet creation
* You define:

  * IP ranges (CIDR)
  * Subnets per region
  * Firewall rules
* More secure and flexible

## 🔹 Advantages

✔ Full IP planning control
✔ Tight security rules
✔ Production-ready design
✔ Supports enterprise architecture

## 🔹 Example Setup

* Public subnet → Web servers
* Private subnet → App servers
* Restricted subnet → Database
* Strict firewall rules

# 3️⃣ Side-by-Side Comparison

| Feature        | Default VPC       | Custom VPC    |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| Creation       | Automatic         | Manual        |
| Subnet Mode    | Auto              | Custom        |
| Firewall Rules | Predefined        | User-defined  |
| Security       | Basic             | Advanced      |
| IP Planning    | Limited           | Full Control  |
| Production Use | ❌ Not Recommended | ✅ Recommended |

# 4️⃣ Real-World Scenario

### Small Student Lab:

Use Default VPC for:

* Quick VM testing
* Learning networking

### Enterprise Banking App:

Use Custom VPC for:

* Multi-tier architecture
* Strict firewall policies
* Controlled IP segmentation
* Hybrid VPN setup

---

# 5️⃣ Interview-Ready Answer (Short)

Default VPC is automatically created with predefined subnets and firewall rules, suitable for learning and testing.
Custom VPC provides full control over IP ranges, subnets, and security policies, and is recommended for production environments.

# ✅ In Simple Words

* Default VPC → Quick & basic
* Custom VPC → Secure & production-ready
* Enterprises always prefer Custom VPC

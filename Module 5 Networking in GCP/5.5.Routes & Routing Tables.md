# Routes & Routing Tables (GCP)

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Routes** and **Routing Tables** control **how network traffic moves inside a VPC**.

In simple terms:

👉 **Routes decide where traffic goes.**
👉 **Routing table stores those rules.**

# 1️⃣ What Is a Route?

A **Route** defines:

* Destination IP range
* Next hop (where traffic should go)

Every route has:

| Component   | Meaning                         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------- |
| Destination | IP range (e.g., 0.0.0.0/0)      |
| Next Hop    | Internet gateway, VM, VPN, etc. |
| Priority    | Determines rule selection order |

# 2️⃣ What Is a Routing Table?

A **Routing Table** is a collection of routes.

* Every VPC has an automatic routing table.
* Routes apply to all subnets within the VPC.
* Subnets do not have separate routing tables in GCP.

---

# 3️⃣ Default Routes in GCP

When a VPC is created, GCP automatically creates:

### 🔹 Default Internet Route

```
Destination: 0.0.0.0/0
Next Hop: Default Internet Gateway
```

This allows VMs with external IPs to access the internet.

---

# 4️⃣ Types of Routes

## 🔹 Default Routes

Created automatically by GCP.

## 🔹 Custom Routes

Manually created for:

* VPN connections
* Hybrid connectivity
* Internal traffic redirection
* Private service routing

---

# 5️⃣ Real-World Example

Scenario:

Company setup:

* Web Server → Needs internet access
* App Server → Internal only
* Database → No internet access

Routing setup:

* Web subnet → Uses default internet route
* App subnet → Internal routing only
* DB subnet → No external route

Traffic flows based on routing decisions.

# 6️⃣ Next Hop Options

Routes can send traffic to:

* Default Internet Gateway
* VPN Tunnel
* Cloud Interconnect
* Internal VM (as router/firewall)
* Peered VPC network

---

# 7️⃣ How Routing Works (Simple Flow)

1. VM sends traffic to a destination.
2. GCP checks routing table.
3. Finds matching destination range.
4. Forwards traffic to the defined next hop.

---

# 8️⃣ Important Concepts

* Longest prefix match is used.
* More specific route (e.g., /24) overrides less specific route (/16).
* Lower priority value = higher priority.
* Routes are global in VPC.

---

# 9️⃣ Interview-Ready Example

If a route exists for:

* `10.0.0.0/16`
* `10.0.1.0/24`

Traffic to `10.0.1.5` will use `/24` route because it is more specific.

---

# ✅ In Simple Words

* Routes tell traffic where to go.
* Routing table stores those rules.
* Default route enables internet access.
* Custom routes support hybrid and advanced networking.

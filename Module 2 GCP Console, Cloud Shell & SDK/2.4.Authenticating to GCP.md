# Authenticating to GCP

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **authentication** is the process of verifying **who you are** before accessing cloud resources.

Authentication works together with **IAM (Identity and Access Management)**, which controls **what you are allowed to do** after logging in.

---

# 1️⃣ Why Authentication Is Required

Before accessing:

* VM instances
* Cloud Storage
* Databases
* Networking resources

You must prove your identity.

Without authentication:
❌ No API access
❌ No CLI access
❌ No Console access

# 2️⃣ Methods of Authentication in GCP

## 🔹 User Account Authentication

Used by:

* Administrators
* Developers
* Cloud engineers

### How It Works:

* Login using Google account
* Authenticated via browser
* Used for Console & CLI

Example (CLI):

```bash
gcloud auth login
```

This opens a browser and authenticates your account.

---

## 🔹 Service Account Authentication

Used by:

* Applications
* VMs
* Automation scripts
* CI/CD pipelines

A **Service Account** is a special identity used by applications instead of humans.

### Real-World Example

A backend application running on a VM needs access to Cloud Storage.
Instead of using a user login, it uses a **service account**.

✔ Secure
✔ No password sharing
✔ Role-based access

---

## 🔹 Application Default Credentials (ADC)

Used when:

* Applications automatically authenticate
* Running inside GCP

If your app runs inside a VM with attached service account:

✔ No manual login required
✔ GCP automatically provides credentials

# 3️⃣ Authentication in Different Environments

| Environment        | Authentication Method    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------ |
| Cloud Console      | Google Login             |
| Cloud Shell        | Auto-authenticated       |
| Local CLI          | `gcloud auth login`      |
| CI/CD              | Service Account          |
| VM Internal Access | Attached Service Account |

---

# 4️⃣ Authentication vs Authorization

* **Authentication** → Who are you?
* **Authorization** → What can you do?

Example:
You login successfully (authentication),
but you cannot delete VM because you lack permission (authorization).

---

# 5️⃣ Security Best Practices

✔ Use Service Accounts for automation
✔ Avoid sharing credentials
✔ Assign minimum required IAM roles
✔ Rotate service account keys if used externally
✔ Prefer Workload Identity over static keys

---

# ✅ In Simple Words

Authenticating to GCP means:

1. Proving your identity
2. Getting secure access
3. Using user accounts or service accounts
4. IAM then controls your permissions

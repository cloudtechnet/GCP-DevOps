# Storage Security & Encryption (GCP)

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, storage security is built around **encryption, access control, identity management, and data protection mechanisms**.

Google follows a **defense-in-depth model**, meaning security is applied at multiple layers.

# 1️⃣ Encryption at Rest

### What It Means

Data stored in:

* Cloud Storage
* Persistent Disks
* Filestore
* Snapshots
* Backups

is automatically encrypted before being written to disk.

### Key Points

✔ Enabled by default
✔ No configuration required
✔ Uses AES-256 encryption

### Real-World Example

A company stores customer invoices in Cloud Storage.
Even if someone physically accesses Google’s disks, data remains unreadable due to encryption.

# 2️⃣ Encryption in Transit

### What It Means

Data moving:

* Between user → GCP
* Between services inside GCP
* Between data centers

is encrypted using TLS.

### Real-World Example

When a user uploads a file via HTTPS to Cloud Storage, it is encrypted during transfer.

# 3️⃣ Encryption Key Management Options

GCP offers three main encryption models:

---

## 🔹 Google-Managed Keys (Default)

* Google handles key creation and rotation
* Simplest option
* Suitable for most workloads

✔ No operational overhead

---

## 🔹 Customer-Managed Keys (CMEK)

* You control encryption keys via Cloud KMS
* Can rotate, disable, or revoke keys

### Real-World Example

A financial organization needs regulatory compliance and must control encryption keys.

✔ More control
✔ Compliance-friendly

---

## 🔹 Customer-Supplied Keys (CSEK)

* You provide encryption key during request
* Google does not store your key

✔ Highest control
❌ Operationally complex

---

# 4️⃣ Access Control & IAM

Encryption alone is not enough.

Access is controlled using:

* IAM roles
* Bucket policies
* Service accounts

### Example

* Developer → Read-only access
* Admin → Full access
* Auditor → Log access only

---

# 5️⃣ Additional Storage Security Features

✔ Object Versioning (protect against accidental deletion)
✔ Retention Policies (prevent deletion for X days)
✔ Uniform bucket-level access
✔ Audit logs for tracking access

# 6️⃣ Security Layers Summary

| Layer                 | Protection Type          |
| --------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Encryption at Rest    | Protects stored data     |
| Encryption in Transit | Protects moving data     |
| IAM                   | Controls access          |
| KMS                   | Controls encryption keys |
| Audit Logs            | Tracks activity          |

# 🔐 Real-World Enterprise Example

A healthcare company:

* Stores patient records in Cloud Storage
* Uses CMEK for encryption
* Enables 7-year retention policy
* Restricts access to compliance team only
* Monitors logs for unauthorized access

This ensures:
✔ Regulatory compliance
✔ Data confidentiality
✔ Audit readiness

# ✅ In Simple Words

GCP storage security works by:

1. Encrypting data automatically
2. Securing data while transferring
3. Controlling access with IAM
4. Allowing advanced key control via KMS

## Cloud Storage

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Cloud Storage** is an **object storage service** designed to store and retrieve **unstructured data** such as files, images, videos, backups, and logs with **high durability and global accessibility**.

## 1️⃣ Buckets & Objects

### 🔹 Buckets

* A **bucket** is a **top-level container** for storing data
* Buckets have:

  * A globally unique name
  * A location (region or multi-region)
  * Storage class and access settings
* Access control and policies are applied at the bucket level

### 🔹 Objects

* An **object** is the actual data stored in a bucket
* Consists of:

  * Data (file content)
  * Metadata (name, size, type, timestamps)
* Objects are immutable (cannot be modified directly—only replaced)

📌 Think of it as:

* Bucket = Folder
* Object = File

## 2️⃣ Storage Classes

Storage classes define **cost and access frequency**. Data can move between classes without changing the bucket.

### 🔹 Standard

* For **frequently accessed data**
* Low latency, high performance
* Higher storage cost

**Use cases:**
Web assets, active application data

---

### 🔹 Nearline

* For **infrequently accessed data** (about once a month)
* Lower cost than Standard
* Slightly higher access cost

**Use cases:**
Monthly backups, disaster recovery data

---

### 🔹 Coldline

* For **rarely accessed data** (a few times per year)
* Lower storage cost
* Higher access cost

**Use cases:**
Compliance data, long-term backups

---

### 🔹 Archive

* For **very rarely accessed data**
* Lowest storage cost
* Highest access latency and cost

**Use cases:**
Legal archives, historical records

---

## 3️⃣ Lifecycle Rules

**Lifecycle rules** automatically manage objects based on conditions.

### What They Do:

* Change storage class over time
* Delete objects automatically
* Reduce manual management

### Common Lifecycle Actions:

* Move objects from Standard → Nearline → Coldline → Archive
* Delete objects after a defined number of days

📌 Benefit:

* Automatic **cost optimization**
* No manual intervention needed

## 4️⃣ Versioning

**Versioning** keeps **multiple versions of an object** when it is overwritten or deleted.

### Key Points:

* Older versions are retained
* Helps recover from accidental deletes or overwrites
* Can be enabled or disabled per bucket

### Use Cases:

* Data protection
* Rollback to previous versions
* Audit and recovery scenarios

📌 Note:

* Old versions consume storage and may increase cost

## ✅ In Simple Words

* **Buckets** hold data
* **Objects** are the files
* **Storage classes** control cost vs access frequency
* **Lifecycle rules** automate cost savings
* **Versioning** protects against data loss

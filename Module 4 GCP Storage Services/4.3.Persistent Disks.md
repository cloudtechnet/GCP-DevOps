## Persistent Disks

In **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Persistent Disks (PDs)** are **durable block storage devices** used with **Compute Engine VMs**. They provide reliable, high-performance storage that **persists independently of VM lifecycle**.

## 1️⃣ Standard vs SSD Persistent Disks

### 🔹 Standard Persistent Disk (pd-standard)

**Characteristics:**

* Backed by HDD
* Lower cost
* Higher latency
* Moderate throughput

**Best For:**

* Boot disks
* Dev/Test environments
* Low I/O workloads
* Batch processing

---

### 🔹 SSD Persistent Disk (pd-ssd)

**Characteristics:**

* Backed by SSD
* Low latency
* High IOPS and throughput
* Higher cost than standard

**Best For:**

* Databases
* High-performance applications
* Latency-sensitive workloads
* Production systems

## 2️⃣ Zonal vs Regional Persistent Disks

### 🔹 Zonal Persistent Disks

**Characteristics:**

* Located in **one zone**
* Attached to VMs in the same zone
* Lower cost
* Single-zone availability

**Best For:**

* Non-critical workloads
* Dev/Test
* Cost-sensitive applications

---

### 🔹 Regional Persistent Disks

**Characteristics:**

* Synchronously replicated across **two zones** in the same region
* High availability
* Automatic failover support
* Higher cost than zonal disks

**Best For:**

* Mission-critical workloads
* Databases requiring high availability
* Production systems

### 🔹 Zonal vs Regional – Quick Comparison

| Feature      | Zonal       | Regional       |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------------- |
| Replication  | Single zone | Multi-zone     |
| Availability | Zone-level  | Region-level   |
| Cost         | Lower       | Higher         |
| Use Case     | Dev/Test    | Production, HA |

## 3️⃣ Choosing the Right Persistent Disk

Ask these questions:

* Is the workload **performance-sensitive**?
* Is **high availability** required?
* Is this **production or non-production**?
* What is the **cost vs performance** balance?

---

## ✅ In Simple Words

* **Standard PD** → Cheaper, slower
* **SSD PD** → Faster, costlier
* **Zonal PD** → Single-zone storage
* **Regional PD** → Multi-zone high availability

Choosing the right disk type ensures **better performance, reliability, and cost optimization**.

## 1️⃣ Object Storage

Designed for **unstructured data** such as images, videos, backups, and logs.

### Key Characteristics:

* Stores data as **objects**
* Highly scalable and durable
* Accessible via APIs and HTTP
* Ideal for global access

### Common Use Cases:

* Application assets
* Media files
* Backups and archives
* Data lakes

---

## 2️⃣ Block Storage

Used as **attached disks** for virtual machines.

### Key Characteristics:

* Acts like a traditional hard disk
* Low-latency access
* Attached to Compute Engine VMs
* Supports boot and data disks

### Common Use Cases:

* Operating system disks
* Databases
* Enterprise applications

---

## 3️⃣ File Storage

Provides **shared file systems** accessible by multiple VMs.

### Key Characteristics:

* Uses standard file system protocols
* Supports shared access
* Suitable for lift-and-shift workloads

### Common Use Cases:

* Shared application data
* Content management systems
* Legacy applications

---

## 4️⃣ Archive & Cold Storage

Optimized for **infrequently accessed data**.

### Key Characteristics:

* Lower storage cost
* Higher access latency
* Long-term retention

### Common Use Cases:

* Compliance data
* Audit logs
* Long-term backups

---

## 5️⃣ Database Storage (Managed)

Storage optimized for **structured data** used by databases.

### Key Characteristics:

* Fully managed
* High availability
* Automated backups and scaling

### Common Use Cases:

* Transactional applications
* Enterprise systems
* Analytics platforms

## 6️⃣ How to Choose the Right Storage Option

Consider:

* Type of data (structured vs unstructured)
* Access frequency
* Performance requirements
* Cost constraints
* Shared vs single-instance access

## ✅ In Simple Words

* **Object storage** → Files & media
* **Block storage** → VM disks
* **File storage** → Shared folders
* **Archive storage** → Long-term data
* **Database storage** → Structured application data
